At its core, the Initial Research Fellowship provides a select group of creatives with the resources to pursue a self-directed, yearlong research project. Fellows receive access to office and project space, where they develop their work through a series of gatherings, including workshops, lectures, screenings, and reading groups. Each participant will present their research internally and will organize public-facing events.",
